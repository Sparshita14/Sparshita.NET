Value types-  stack, directly, int, float, long, enum, struct
	Static
	Fixed size (overflow exception)
	Easy to get

Reference types-heap, using class, interface, string, array, object, delegate.
	Dynamic
	Find to get
	
garbage collector only deallocates in heap.
as in stack it is deallocated automatically in stack.

memory value of heap is stored in stack and the size of stack depends on system config (34bit/64bit).

stack used by one thread exection
heap can be used by all parts of the app

type safety- bigger to lower data loss not vice versa
	  
type conversion depends on the range
